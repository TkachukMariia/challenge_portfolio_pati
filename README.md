Task 1: Software configuration
Subtask 1: 'Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?'

Hello! 
My name is Mariia. I'm 33 years old. I decided to participate in the project because
I have a goal to change my main profession. It's very important for me so I do everything that I can even bigger.

I am glad that I found Dare IT and have the opportunity to participate in an incredibly interesting project.
My expectations from the project are to gain knowledge and get a chance to complete an internship in a company with
experienced colleagues and further cooperation.

Have a nice day!
